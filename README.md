## 1.1. Problem Statement ##
[[back to the top]](#table-of-contents)
Using machine learning model on walking data, as an extension to domain knowledge in biomechanics help clinicians evaluate response and outcomes to treatments provided.

## 1.2. Background ##
[[back to the top]](#table-of-contents)

In addition to Singapore’s ageing population, there are many factors affecting walking gait, balance, mobility and quality of life.

Common issues affecting walking are: <br>
* Osteoarthritis
* Parkinson's disease
* Stroke
* Muscular atropy
* Hip fractures 
* Musculoskeletal injuries
* Loss of balance

<br>

## 1.3. Data ##

Publicly available online database:
* https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/GaitRec_A_large-scale_ground_reaction_force_dataset_of_healthy_and_impaired_gait/4788012
    
GAITREC is a large dataset containing bi-lateral GRF walking trials of over 2000 patients with labelled gait disorders, as well as over 200 healthy controls.
It includes joint replacement, fractures, ligament ruptures, and related disorders at the hip, knee, ankle or calcaneus during entire stay in rehabilitation center.
