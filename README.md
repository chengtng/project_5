# 1. Project Description
[[back to the top]](#table-of-contents) <br>

## 1.1. Problem Statement ##
[[back to the top]](#table-of-contents) <br>
Using machine learning model on walking data from GaitRec database, this project aims to infer key features that relates with different walking issues. As an extension to domain knowledge, we can use additional features indentified in this project to help suggest affordable wearable sensors that target these key features that can help clinicians monitor the outcomes of treatment. <br>

## 1.2. Background ##
[[back to the top]](#table-of-contents) <br>

In addition to Singaporeâ€™s ageing population, there are many factors affecting walking gait, balance, mobility and quality of life. <br>

Common issues affecting walking are: <br>
* Osteoarthritis
* Parkinson's disease
* Stroke
* Muscular atropy
* Hip fractures 
* Musculoskeletal injuries
* Loss of balance

<br>

Among 150,000 household surveyed in 2020 population census, 62,500 people faced mobility challenges such as walking and climbing steps. (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/100000-singapore-residents-face-difficulties-performing-basic-activities-population-census)

<br>
    
GAITREC is a large dataset containing bi-lateral GRF walking trials of over 2000 patients with labelled gait disorders, as well as over 200 healthy controls.
It includes joint replacement, fractures, ligament ruptures, and related disorders at the hip, knee, ankle or calcaneus during entire stay in rehabilitation center. [1]

**Processing of Data**
* The data are time normalised to 100% of a stride
* The data is resampled from 90-400 readings to 100 readings
* Force readings are normalised by participant's weight

**Conclusion:**
1. Using key features like BMI, Age, maximum landing force, push force, together with differences in vertical and horizontal forces between left and right leg can approximately reach 70% accuracy in classification of gait, which is a good alternative to the neural network of 92% trained with 1000 features derived from sophisticated force plate only available in a dedicated lab.
2. There is feasibility in exploring more key features and affordable sensors that target these key features in solutions and research available currently.

**Future Exploration:** <br>
* Work in progress
